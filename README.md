BackEnd Coding Challenge
Idea of the App
The task is to implement a small server application which will have basic functionalities such as authentication, role management, etc. Make schemas based on any FMCG commercial app but on a small scale.

Features
App should have Bearer authentication
Restrict some routes to a specific role such as list of customers can be called with admin role
App should have CRUD, filter(category, price band, name etc.), pagination queries
Implement swagger doc for api endpoints
Things to keep in mind
Your code will be evaluated on:

whether the technologies required are used
code structure
programming best practices
legibility
Also we would like you to use git repo when you start coding so we can check your commits and your fluency with github/gitlab. Add a separate commit so we know how you use commit standards and at same time how good you can breakup tasks while doing commit of code.

Technologies to use
We'd like to see your implementation using the following technologies:

Express / Nest with Typescript
Mongodb or any other SQL database of your choice
If not sharing project in typescript please do mention that before hand
How to submit the challenge solution?
After you finished your app, please follow the instructions below:

Share your repository link to us - can be a public repository on gitlab or github
Share a postman collection of your endpoints
Mention the time you spent on this
You can use any boilerplate from internet instead of setting up own from scratch to save time.
